## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael

I stumbled into the realm of coding while making an audiovisual art project. 
It's where my creative roots and data-fascinated brain collided.

### ðŸ’» Programmer
I'm passionate about coding and exploring interesting and new realms of projects from creating immersive audiovisual performances with IoT sensors to advanced NLP analysis with the novel Dracula to delving into baseball sabermetric statistics. My love for programming knows no bounds.

### ðŸ“Š Data Enthusiast
I love decoding data. Whether it's natural language processing analysis or unraveling the secrets hidden in datasets, I love the thrill of turning raw data into impactful insights.

### ðŸŽ¨ Art Lover
Beyond the pixels and code, I'm art-obsessed. I enjoy producing unique AV projects, playing music, drawing, painting, videography, photography, and much more in my free time.
