## Hi there 👋 I'm Michael

I stumbled into the realm of programming through art. 
It's where my creative roots and data-fascinated brain collided.

### 💻 Programmer
I'm passionate about coding and exploring interesting projects from creating immersive audiovisual performances with IoT sensors to advanced NLP analytics with Bram Stoker's Dracula to delving into baseball's sabermetric statistics, my love for programming knows no bounds.

### 📊 Data Enthusiast
I love decoding data.

### 🎨 Art Lover
Beyond the pixels and code, I'm art-obsessed.
