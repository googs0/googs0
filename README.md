### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael

#### Welcome to my creative playground

In my former life, I earned my wings as an artist, audio engineer, and videographer--now, I channel that multidimensional experience into my programming endeavors. I stumbled into the realm of coding while making an 
audiovisual art project. It's where my creative roots and logical, data-oriented mind collided

### ðŸ’» Programmer
I'm passionate about coding, exploring fascinating domains from creating immersive audiovisual performances with IoT sensors to delving into advanced baseball statistics and diving deep into regression and predictive modeling. My love for programming knows no bounds.

### ðŸ“Š Data Enthusiast
Numbers tell stories, and I'm here to decode them. Whether it's natural language processing analysis or unraveling the secrets hidden in datasets, I love the thrill of turning raw data into impactful insights.

### ðŸŽ¨ Art Lover
Beyond the pixels and code, I'm art-obsessed. I believe blending technology and creativity can take programming (and art) to new heights. I enjoy producing unique and visually stunning AV projects in my free time.
